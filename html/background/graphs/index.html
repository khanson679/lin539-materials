<h2 id="the-basics-of-graphs">The basics of graphs</h2>
<p>A graph consists of at least two components. The first is the set of nodes. When talking about graphs, every node is usually called a <strong>vertex</strong>, so instead of the graph’s set of nodes we talk about the graph’s set <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> of <strong>vertices</strong>. In addition, there is an edge relation <span class="math inline">\(E \subseteq V \times V\)</span> that connects vertices to each other. When drawing graphs, the edges in <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> are represented by arrows.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>The graph depicted below has <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 0,1,2,\ldots,11 \right \}\)</span> as its set of vertices, and <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> consists of the following tuples:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 0,3 \right \rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 0,6 \right \rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 0,9 \right \rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 3,0 \right \rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 3,6 \right \rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 3,9 \right \rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 6,0 \right \rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 6,3 \right \rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 6,9 \right \rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 9,0 \right \rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 9,3 \right \rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 9,6 \right \rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 1,4 \right \rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 1,7 \right \rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 1,10 \right \rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 4,1 \right \rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 4,7 \right \rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 4,10 \right \rangle\)</span></li>
<li>and so on</li>

</div>
<p>By default, we take the edges of a graph to be <em>directed</em>: <span class="math inline">\(a E b\)</span> does not imply <span class="math inline">\(b E a\)</span>. This is why we depicted edges with arrows. You may think of them as a one-way roads.</p>
<p>In the special case where <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is symmetric, we call the graph <strong>undirected</strong>. It is customary to draw undirected graphs with undirected edges rather than separate arrows in both directions. Since the edge relation in our example graph is symmetric, we can draw it in a much simpler fashion using undirected edges.</p>
<p><img src="modulo3_undirected.svg" alt="modulo3_undirected.svg" /></p>
<p>If the edge relation is transitive, it is also customary not to draw any edges that can be inferred by transitivity. This convention further simplifies how we depict our example graph.</p>
<p><img src="modulo3_undirected_notransitive.svg" alt="modulo3_undirected_notransitive.svg" /></p>
<p>But keep in mind that these three pictures all define the same graph, we are merely using various notational conventions to remove clutter from our pictures. Mathematically, how we draw graphs has nothing to do with their definition.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>A <em>graph</em> is a pair <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle V, E \right \rangle\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is a set of <strong>vertices</strong> and <span class="math inline">\(E \subseteq V \times V\)</span> is the <strong>edge</strong> relation.</p>
</div>
<p>Note that the definition above treats undirected graphs as the special case of directed graphs where <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is symmetric. Some authors instead assume that graphs are undirected by default and use the term <strong>digraph</strong> to refer to a directed graph. Either one is fine, of course, but for linguistics directed graphs are usually more important than undirected ones, which is why we will continue to treat undirected graphs as a special case of directed graphs.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>For each on the hierarchies listed below, define its corresponding graph.</p>
<ul>
<li>the person hierarchy</li>
<li>the person-person hierarchy used for the PCC</li>
<li>the case hierarchy for noun stem allmorphy</li>
</ul>
<p>Each edge you posit should correspond to a line in the figure for the relevant hierarchy.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="paths-and-reachability">Paths and Reachability</h3>
<p>One of the central notions for graphs is <strong>reachability</strong>. A vertex <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is reachable from vertex <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> iff we can follow a sequence of edges from <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. This sequence is called a <strong>path</strong>.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider one more the following graph, and assume that the edge relation contains a pair <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle a,b \right \rangle\)</span> iff there is a line from <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> in the picture:</p>
<p><img src="modulo3_undirected_notransitive.svg" alt="modulo3_undirected_notransitive.svg" /></p>
<p>Here <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> is reachable from <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> because there is an edge taking us from <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>. But <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> is also reachable from <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> as we can first move to <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> and from there <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span>. The path from <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> can be written as <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 0,3,6 \right \rangle\)</span>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> is not reachable from <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. No matter which sequence of edges we take from <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, there is no way to ever get to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p>A <strong>path</strong> through a graph <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle V, E \right \rangle\)</span> is a sequence <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle v_1, \ldots, v_n \right \rangle\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(n \geq 2\)</span>) such that <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle v_i, v_{i+1} \right \rangle \in E\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(1 \leq i &lt; n\)</span>. For all <span class="math inline">\(a, b \in V\)</span>, we say that <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is reachable from <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> iff there is a path <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle v_1, \ldots, v_n \right \rangle\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(v_1 = a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_n = b\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>As always in mathematics, there are multiple ways of saying the same thing, and the same is true for reachability. A node <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is reachable from <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> in graph <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle V, E \right \rangle\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle a,b \right \rangle\)</span> is member of the transitive closure of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>. The transitive closure of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is the smallest <span class="math inline">\(E&#39;\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(E \subseteq E&#39; \subseteq V \times V\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(E&#39;\)</span> is transitive.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider the graph below.</p>
<p><img src="modulo3_directed_weak.svg" alt="modulo3_directed_weak.svg" /></p>
<p>Its edge relation <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> consists of the pairs <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 0,3 \right \rangle\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 0,9 \right \rangle\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 3,6 \right \rangle\)</span>. The transitive closure <span class="math inline">\(E&#39;\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> also contains <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 0,6 \right \rangle\)</span>. This is the smallest superset of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> that is transitive. The transitive closure of <span class="math inline">\(E&#39;\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(E&#39;\)</span> itself — since <span class="math inline">\(E&#39;\)</span> is already transitive, nothing needs to be added. The symmetric closure <span class="math inline">\(E&#39;&#39;\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(E&#39;\)</span> must also contain <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 3,0 \right \rangle\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 9,0 \right \rangle\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 6,3 \right \rangle\)</span>. Now if we take the transitive closure of <span class="math inline">\(E&#39;&#39;\)</span>, every node is connected to every node, so the edge relation is identical to <span class="math inline">\(V \times V\)</span>. Thus the transitive, symmetric closure of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(V \times V\)</span> because there is no smaller extension of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> that is both symmetric and transitive.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="connectedness-of-graphs">Connectedness of graphs</h2>
<p>Graphs can have varying degrees of connectivity. Connectedness measures the degree to which every node in the graph is reachable from some other graph.</p>
<p>A <strong>disconnected</strong> graph is one where there are nodes <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> such that even if one ignores the direction of the edge relation, one cannot get from <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. So if we were to construct the graph in the real world as a kind of mobile, we would not be able to hang the graph on the wall with a single hook because not all parts hang together — at least one part would fall to the ground.</p>
<p>A <strong>weakly connected</strong> graph is such that it forms one cohesive whole via the edge relation, but there might be nodes <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> such that neither one can be reached from the other unless one ignores the direction of edges. A <strong>connected graph</strong> satisfies the strong property that for all nodes <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is reachable from <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> or the other way round. A <strong>strongly connected</strong> graph, finally, is such that every node is reachable from every node.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>A directed graph is</p>
<ul>
<li><em>weakly connected</em> iff the reflexive, symmetric, transitive closure of its edge relation is total,</li>
<li><em>connected</em> iff the reflexive, transitive closure of its edge relation is total,</li>
<li><em>strongly connected</em> iff the reflexive, transitive closure of its edge relation is identical to <span class="math inline">\(V \times V\)</span>,</li>
<li><em>disconnected</em> iff it is not weakly connected.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>The undirected graph we saw at the beginning of the previous unit is disconnected, and the same goes for any directed version of it. For example, there is no edge between <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, one simply cannot be reached from the other.</p>
<p><img src="modulo3_undirected_notransitive.svg" alt="modulo3_undirected_notransitive.svg" /></p>
<p>However, we can identify parts of the graph that are connected.</p>
<p><img src="modulo3_undirected_component.svg" alt="modulo3_undirected_component.svg" /></p>
<p>Even though there is no edge between <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span>, the transitive closure of the edge relation does connect the two.</p>
<p>Now let us look at a directed graph, where multiple degrees of connectedness need to be distinguished.</p>
<p><img src="modulo3_directed_strong.svg" alt="modulo3_directed_strong.svg" /></p>
<p>The directed graph above is strongly connected. When we take the reflexive, transitive closure of the edge relation, every node is reachable from every node. This is exactly what it means to be strongly connected.</p>
<p>But a slight change in the edge relation suffices to reduce strong connectedness to connectedness.</p>
<p><img src="modulo3_directed_connected.svg" alt="modulo3_directed_connected.svg" /></p>
<p>Even if we look at the reflexive, transitive closure of the edge relation, there is no path from <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, from <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, or from <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. So we can no longer reach every node from every node. But for any two nodes <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, it still holds that <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> can be reached from <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> can be reached from <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. Hence the reflexive, transitive closure of the edge relation is still total, and we have a connected graph.</p>
<p>Finally, consider what happens if we remove one edge from the graph above.</p>
<p><img src="modulo3_directed_weak.svg" alt="modulo3_directed_weak.svg" /></p>
<p>Now even the reflexive, transitive closure of the edge relation does not connect <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span>, so the graph cannot be connected. However, <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span> are still reachable from each other if we consider the reflexive, symmetric, transitive closure of the edge relation. Therefore, the graph is weakly connected.</p>
</div>
<p>Intuitively, the three degrees of connectivity can be described in terms of how we have to move along the arrows in a graph to read one node from another one:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we can reach every node from every node by following a sequence of arrows, the graph is strongly connected.</li>
<li>If we can reach <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> by following a sequence of arrows, but not necessarily <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, the graph is connected.</li>
<li>If we have to sometimes go against the direction of the arrow to get from <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, the graph is weakly connected.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is every strongly connected graph weakly connected? Justify your answer.</p>
