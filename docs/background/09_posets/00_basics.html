<h1 id="posets">Posets</h1>
<div class="prereqs">
<ul>
<li>tuples (basics)</li>
<li>relations (basic orders)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>While sets are unstructured, they can be combined with an ordering relation to yield a structured object. Usually, this will be a partial order. A set with a partial order defined over it is a <strong>partially ordered set</strong> or simply <strong>poset</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>
<p>In mathematical terms, a poset is usually treated as a tuple <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle S, R \right \rangle\)</span> that consists of the set <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and the order <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> defined over its elements. Don’t attach too much significance to this, it is just a matter of notation and you wouldn’t want to apply the usual tuple operations to these objects. For instance, we wouldn’t want to concatenate the posets <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle S_1, R_1 \right \rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle S_2, R_2 \right \rangle\)</span> to get a 4-tuple <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle S_1, R_1, S_2, R_2 \right \rangle\)</span>, that doesn’t make much sense.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>A <strong>partially ordered set</strong>, or simple <strong>poset</strong>, is a pair <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle S, R \right \rangle\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is some set and <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is a partial order over <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. <!-- If $R$ is a weak/strict partial order, then $\tuple{S, R}$ is also called a weak/strict poset. --></p>
</div>
<p>Sometimes, <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is also called the <strong>carrier</strong> of the poset <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle S, R \right \rangle\)</span>.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>The set of natural numbers is <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N} \mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{ 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots \right \}\)</span>. By itself, it has no internal order. But of course we can order the natural numbers according to the familiar relation <span class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span>, and then we get the poset <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle \mathbb{N}, \leq \right \rangle\)</span>. The carrier of <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle \mathbb{N}, \leq \right \rangle\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>We can take the set <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> of all humans that ever lived or are currently alive. We then order this set by the ancestor relation. Since that is a partial order, the result is a poset. <!-- If we treat every human as an ancestor of themselves, the ancestor relation is a weak partial order, so once again we get a weak poset. --> <!-- If we use the more intuitive definition, then we get a strict poset. --></p>
</div>
<h2 id="visualizing-posets">Visualizing posets</h2>
<p>Often it is very useful to visualize posets. In this case, elements of the set are represented as nodes in a figure, and arrows between the nodes indicate that they are related via the order relation. Here is what this looks like for the natural numbers ordered by <span class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="natnum_lessthan_redundant.svg" alt="natnum_lessthan_redundant.svg" /></p>
<p>Since that is very convoluted, it is customary to omit arrows that can be inferred from the properties of the order. First, one omits all arrows that can be inferred from transitivity. That is to say, if there is an arrow from <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and another arrow from <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>, we do not need an arrow from <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="natnum_lessthan_loops.svg" alt="natnum_lessthan_loops.svg" /></p>
<p>And if we know that the ordering relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is such that <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} x\)</span> holds for every <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, then we do not need all the loops either.</p>
<p><img src="natnum_lessthan_simplified.svg" alt="natnum_lessthan_simplified.svg" /></p>
<p><strong>Caution:</strong> due to these conventions, a depiction of <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle \mathbb{N}, \leq \right \rangle\)</span> will look the same as one for <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle \mathbb{N}, &lt; \right \rangle\)</span>, but those are different posets.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Take the set <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z} \mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{ 0, -1, 1, -2, 2, -3, 3, \ldots \right \}\)</span> of integers. Let <span class="math inline">\(x \prec y\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(x^2 \leq y^2\)</span>. Sketch a figure of the poset <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle \mathbb{Z}, \prec \right \rangle\)</span>. Avoid all arrows that can be inferred from the general properties of <span class="math inline">\(\prec\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> be the set of all substrings of the word <em>poset</em>. Draw the strict poset <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle S, \sqsubset \right \rangle\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\sqsubset\)</span> is the proper substring relation: <span class="math inline">\(x \sqsubset y\)</span> iff there is some <span class="math inline">\(z \neq \varepsilon\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(x \cdot z = y\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now suppose that we used <span class="math inline">\(\sqsubseteq\)</span> instead: <span class="math inline">\(x \sqsubseteq y\)</span> iff there is some (possibly empty) <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(x \cdot z = y\)</span>. Do you have to change anything about your figure?</p>
