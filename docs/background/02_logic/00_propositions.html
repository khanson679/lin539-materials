<h1 id="propositions">Propositions</h1>
<h2 id="intuition">Intuition</h2>
<p>A proposition is a statement that is either true or false. This does not mean that one can necessarily tell whether a proposition is true, nor that the proposition makes any sense considering what our world is like. It just means that the statement is such that it can have a truth value.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>All of the following are propositions, even though whether they’re true or false can depend greatly on context:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nobody likes ponies.</li>
<li>He always snores like a pig.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(2 + 2 = 4\)</span></li>
<li>We might see another stock market crash soon.</li>
<li>A language is regular iff it is recognized by a finite-state automaton.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>The following are not propositions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you mad?</li>
<li>Please open a window.</li>
<li>Hell, yeah!</li>
<li>A cute kitten</li>
<li>John and Mary</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>Some cases are borderline and require some more detailed analysis. Take <em>Either John leaves or I will</em>. As a literal description of how the world is, this can be either true or false, so it’s a proposition. But we can also interpret it as a command that the addressee must choose between John and the speaker. Commands have no truth value and thus aren’t propositions.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>For each one of the following, say whether it is a proposition. If you say no, justify your answer.</p>
<ul>
<li>John and Peter met yesterday.</li>
<li>The DeLorean DMC-12 is a sports car originally manufactured by John DeLorean’s DeLorean Motor Company.</li>
<li>Who would say no to that.</li>
<li>That son of a gun has fooled us all.</li>
<li>Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.</li>
<li>John and Mary have only one child, who has three siblings.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 id="entailment">Entailment</h2>
<p>Some propositions are atomic in the sense that one cannot break them down into smaller propositions, whereas others are clearly built up from smaller propositions.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>The sentence <em>John rode a bike and Mary her dragon</em> might be true or false, so it’s a proposition. But it is not an atomic proposition because it’s built up from two smaller propositions. One is <em>John rode a bike</em>, the other one <em>Mary rode her dragon</em> (that English allows for the verb to be omitted in the second conjunct is irrelevant for this point).</p>
</div>
<p>As a result, propositions can be related to each other so that the truth value of one follows immediately from the other. This is called <strong>entailment</strong>.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>If <em>John rode a bike and Mary her dragon</em> is true, then it must also be true that John rode a bike, and it must be true that Mary rode her dragon. In the other direction, if <em>John rode a bike</em> is false, then so is <em>John rode a bike and Mary her dragon</em>.</p>
</div>
<p>Entailment can also hold between propositions that do not stand in an obvious part-whole relation to each other.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider the sentences <em>If pigs can fly, then Sokrates is a chain-smoking dragon</em> and <em>No human is a dragon</em>. Assuming that both are true, the sentence <em>Sokrates is human</em> entails that pigs cannot fly.</p>
</div>
<p>The entailments in these two examples are slightly different. For the first, it suffices to recognize how one proposition was built up from smaller ones. The second one presents a more complex reasoning pattern that hinges on the meaning of the quantifier <em>no</em>. Logic was devised as a means to study these different kinds of entailments, but over the centuries it has evolved to a highly flexible system that can be used for all kinds of purposes.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>For each one of the following pairs of sentences, say whether entailment holds, and if so, in which direction. If entailment does not hold, explain why.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>John likes his son’s sisters. | John likes his daughters.</p></li>
<li><p>I am 30 years old. | My age is a multiple of 15.</p></li>
<li><p>1 is not a prime number. | No prime numbers is less than 2.</p></li>
<li><p>John and Bill both left the party early. | Bill left the party around 9.</p></li>
<li><p>The 45th US president isn’t universally beloved. | Donald Trump isn’t universally beloved.</p></li>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(2 + 2 = 4\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(2 + 2 = 4\)</span>. | <span class="math inline">\(2 + 2 = 4\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
