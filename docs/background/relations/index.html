<h2 id="relations">Relations</h2>
<p>Relations are similar to functions in that they establish connections between objects. But whereas a function associates only one output with every input, a relation is more flexible and allows connections to arbitrarily many elements.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>The question <em>Is <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> a biological child of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span></em> is a function because it maps any two <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> to either true or false, but never both. But if we slightly change the question to just <em>Name a biological child of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span></em>, we are no longer dealing with a function because multiple answers are possible if <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> has more than one child. Instead, we can talk about the <em>biological child</em> relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is related to <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> via <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is a biological child of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="basic-notation">Basic notation</h3>
<p>Given some relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, we write <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> to indicate that <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> relates <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. Note that <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> does not imply that <span class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} x\)</span> also holds, nor that it doesn’t hold.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>One relation you know very well is the “less than” relation <span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span> over numbers. When we write <span class="math inline">\(5 &lt; 7\)</span>, we are saying that the relation <span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span> relates <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(7\)</span>. However, it is not the case that <span class="math inline">\(7\)</span> is related to <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> via <span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span>, since <span class="math inline">\(7 &lt; 5\)</span> does not hold.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>Suppose <em>John</em> has exactly two siblings, <em>Mary</em> and <em>Sue</em>. Then the sibling relation establishes two connections for John: <em>John</em>-<em>Mary</em>, and <em>John</em>-<em>Sue</em>. Using <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> for the sibling relation, we have <span class="math inline">\(\text{John} \mathrel{S} \text{Mary}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\text{John} \mathrel{S} \text{Sue}\)</span>.</p>
<p>In contrast to <span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span>, the sibling relation is <strong>symmetric</strong>. That is to say, if Mary is a sibling of John, then John is also a sibling of Mary. Therefore we also have <span class="math inline">\(\text{Mary} \mathrel{S} \text{John}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\text{Sue} \mathrel{S} \text{John}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The relation is also <strong>transitive</strong>. If John is a sibling of Mary, and Sue is a sibling of John, then Sue is a sibling of Mary. So is also holds that <span class="math inline">\(\text{Mary} \mathrel{S} \text{Sue}\)</span>, and via symmetry we also get <span class="math inline">\(\text{Sue} \mathrel{S} \text{Mary}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Overall, we have <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{S} y\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(x, y \in \left \{ \text{John}, \text{Mary}, \text{Sue} \right \}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x \neq y\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>The <strong>substring relation</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\sqsubseteq\)</span> holds between two strings <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is a substring of <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>. That is to say, <span class="math inline">\(u \subseteq v\)</span> iff there are <span class="math inline">\(w, w&#39; \in \Sigma^*\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(w \cdot u \cdot w&#39; = v\)</span>. Note that for any given string <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>, there are infinitely many <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> that <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is a substring of. Even if the alphabet contains only <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, the string <span class="math inline">\(aa\)</span> is a substring of <span class="math inline">\(aaa\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(aaaa\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(aaaaa\)</span>, and so on, ad infinitum. It is also a substring of itself (in this case, <span class="math inline">\(w = w&#39; = \varepsilon\)</span>).</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>Relations can be defined over more complex objects like sets. An example of this is the subset relation <span class="math inline">\(\subseteq\)</span>. The set <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1 \right \}\)</span> is a subset of infinitely many other sets: <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 0,1 \right \}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1,2 \right \}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 0,1,2 \right \}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1,3 \right \}\)</span>, and so on.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>Just like a function can take multiple arguments to return a single output, a relation can connect multiple elements. In the real world, the “jointly conceived” relation <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> would connect two individuals to their offspring. So the expression <span class="math display">\[\text{John}, \text{Mary} \mathrel{R} \text{Sue}\]</span> encodes that John and Mary are the biological parents of Sue (let’s just hope that those are not the same people as in the first example).</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>Here is an example of a very abstract relation. Consider the space of all possible functions from real numbers to real numbers — that’s a lot of functions. Now let’s define a boundedness relation <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> which relates function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> to function <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \leq g(x)\)</span> for every natural number <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Suppose, for instance, that <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g(x) = x^2\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(f \mathrel{B} g\)</span>, but not <span class="math inline">\(g \mathrel{B} f\)</span>.</p>
<p>Many functions aren’t related via <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> at all. One example of this is <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = -x + 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g(x) = x^2\)</span>. It is the case that <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \leq g(x)\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(x \geq 1\)</span>, but <span class="math inline">\(f(0) = 1 &gt; 0 = g(0)\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>We will mostly be dealing with the special case of <strong>binary relations</strong> where exactly one element is related to some other element.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Almost all relations above are binary relations. The only exception is the “jointly conceived” relation <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span>, which is a ternary relation as it relates three elements.</p>
</div>
<p>Given a binary relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(a \mathrel{R}\)</span> is the set of objects that <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is related to. Similarly, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrel{R} b\)</span> is the set of objects that are related to <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. <span class="math display">\[
a \mathrel{R} \mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{  b \mid a \mathrel{R} b \right \}
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
\mathrel{R} b \mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{  a \mid a \mathrel{R} b \right \}
\]</span></p>
<div class="example">
<p>Suppose that the parent-of relation <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> establishes the following relations between elements: <span class="math inline">\(\text{John} \mathrel{P} \text{Sue}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\text{Mary} \mathrel{P} \text{Sue}\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(\text{John} \mathrel{P} = \left \{ \text{Sue} \right \}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrel{P} \text{Sue} = \left \{  \text{John}, \text{Mary} \right \}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> be the relation that connects words to their parts of speech (N for nouns, V for verbs, A for adjectives, P for prepositions, D for determiners, and so on). List the following for English:</p>
<ul>
<li>export <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span></li>
<li>apple <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> P</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 id="relations-versus-functions">Relations versus functions</h3>
<p>Every function can be regarded as a relation.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider the function <span class="math inline">\(f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(x \mapsto 2x\)</span>. It is identical to the relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(y = 2x\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>The crucial difference between functions and relations is that functions are <strong>right-unique relations</strong>. That’s a fancy way of saying that a function cannot provide more than one output, whereas a relation can unless it is right-unique. When we view a function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> as a relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, then it must hold for every <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> that <span class="math inline">\(a \mathrel{R}\)</span> is either empty or contains exactly one element. Hence the term right-unique: if we look at the expression <span class="math inline">\(a \mathrel{R} b\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is the left side and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> the right side. If there cannot be more than one choice for <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, then the right side of <span class="math inline">\(a \mathrel{R} b\)</span> is uniquely determined.</p>
<p>The bottom line: every function is a relation, but not every relation is a function. If <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is related to two elements or more (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\left | a \mathrel{R} \right | \geq 2\)</span>), then <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> cannot be a function.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>For each one of the following, say whether it is a function or just a relation.</p>
<ul>
<li>the parent-of relation (e.g. <span class="math inline">\(j \mathrel{P} m\)</span> for “John is a parent of Mary”)</li>
<li>the parent-of relation in a world where the one-child policy is enforced globally</li>
<li>the relation between a car’s license plate and its owners</li>
<li>the prefix relation, where <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is a prefix of <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> iff there is some <span class="math inline">\(w \in \Sigma^*\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(v = u \cdot w\)</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Is the following statement true or false? Justify your answer.</p>
<p>Every relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> can be regarded as a function that maps <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="recap">Recap</h3>
<ul>
<li>Relations are a generalization of functions in that a single input can be related to many distinct outputs.</li>
<li>Given some relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, we write <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> to indicate that <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> relates <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.</li>
<li>We mostly focus on binary relations.</li>
<li>For binary relations, we have the following notation: <span class="math display">\[
a \mathrel{R} \mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{  b \mid a \mathrel{R} b \right \}
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
\mathrel{R} b \mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{  a \mid a \mathrel{R} b \right \}
\]</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="order-relations-the-intuition">Order relations: the intuition</h2>
<p>A binary relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> can be combined with a set <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> to define an <strong>ordered set</strong>. Think of it as follows: whereas the elements of a normal set are just floating around in limbo with no ties between them, an ordered set uses some ordering relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> to lock its elements into place. This unit only covers the intuition behind orders, and the formal definitions are left to the next one.</p>
<h3 id="examples-of-ordered-sets">Examples of ordered sets</h3>
<div class="example">
<p>The prototypical example of an order is the “equal or less than” relation <span class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span> over the set <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> of natural numbers. While the set of natural numbers is unordered, we can use <span class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span> to define the usual order over it with <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> at the beginning, followed by <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, which is followed by <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, and so on.</p>
</div>
<p><img src="natnum_lessthan.svg" alt="natnum_lessthan.svg" /></p>
<div class="example">
<p>We could have defined a very different kind of order over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> be a function that maps each natural number <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to the recursive sum of its digits. That is to say, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> first sums up all the digits, then sums up the digits of the sum, and so on, until only a single digit remains. The computation for <span class="math inline">\(537\)</span>, for instance, would proceed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(537: 5 + 3 + 7 = 15\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(15: 1 + 5 = 6\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Consequently, <span class="math inline">\(f(537) = 6\)</span>. Note that <span class="math inline">\(f(537) = f(357) = f(753) = f(861) = f(96) = f(15) = f(6)\)</span>, so many different numbers have the same sum of digits. Now we define an order <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(f(x) &lt; f(y)\)</span>. That’s a very different way of ordering the natural numbers, but it’s still an order.</p>
</div>
<p><img src="natnum_digitsum.svg" alt="natnum_digitsum.svg" /></p>
<div class="example">
<p>The standard way of reciting the alphabet in English can be regarded as an order on the set <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z \right \}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="not-every-binary-relation-is-an-order">Not every binary relation is an order</h3>
<p>The essential aspect of orders is that they allow us to say that some element is in some sense less relevant or prominent than some other element. The <span class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span> relation, for instance, orders numbers from small to big. We are effectively ranking the elements of the set.</p>
<p>Not every binary relation gives rise to such a ranking.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Suppose that we define the following binary relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> over the set <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1,2,3 \right \}\)</span> of person features: <span class="math inline">\(1 \mathrel{R} 2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(1 \mathrel{R} 3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(2 \mathrel{R} 3\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(3 \mathrel{R} 2\)</span>. That’s not really a ranking. Yes, we can see that <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> is ranked higher than <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> (or lower, depending on how you look at it). But <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> are not clearly ranked with respect to each other. On the one hand <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> is higher than <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, and on the other hand <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> is higher than <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. We have a kind of cycle, and that’s not okay for orders.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>Now consider the successor relation <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> over natural numbers. Here <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{S} y\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(y = x + 1\)</span>. So we have <span class="math inline">\(0 \mathrel{S} 1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(1 \mathrel{S} 2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(2 \mathrel{S} 3\)</span>, and so on. Even though this might look like it generates the same order as <span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span>, it’s not an order at all. The problem is that the relation does not relate elements that should be related if this were an actual ranking.</p>
<p>Just look at <span class="math inline">\(0 \mathrel{S} 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1 \mathrel{S} 2\)</span>. This tells us that <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> is ranked higher than <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> is ranked higher than <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> (again, it doesn’t matter if we say “ranked higher” or “ranked lower”). But in a normal ranking, this would mean that <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> is also ranked higher than <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. Yet we do not have <span class="math inline">\(0 \mathrel{S} 2\)</span>. According to <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> are completely unrelated, contradicting our intuitions about how a ranking ought to work. In a ranking, it is always the case that if <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> outranks something that outranks <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> outranks <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>For this reason, an ordered set has to use a binary relation that is in some sense ranking-like. Among other things, this means that the relation can’t contain loops or cycles, and it must not have gaps that would be filled in if it were actually a ranking. If this seems awfully fuzzy to you, just focus on the intuition for now and check out the formal definitions in the next unit.</p>
<h3 id="linear-and-partial-orders">Linear and partial orders</h3>
<p>There are numerous types of orders, and the next unit covers them in detail. For now, it suffices to be aware of the major split between <strong>total orders</strong> and <strong>partial orders</strong>. Total orders are also called <strong>linear orders</strong>, which conveys the essential intuition behind them: a relation is a total order if it can be represented by writing all elements in a single line. A partial order is more flexible and allows some elements to be unordered with respect to each other, as long as this does not violate our requirement that the relation must be ranking-like.</p>
<p>Let’s consider once more the examples above. The relation <span class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span> defines a total order over the set of natural numbers as there are no two elements that are unordered with respect to each other. No matter which two numbers <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> we look at, we either have <span class="math inline">\(x \leq y\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(y \leq x\)</span>. And if we have both <span class="math inline">\(x \leq y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y \leq x\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> must be the same number. So we can’t have any odd situations like a loop from 10 back to 5. Hence we do indeed end up with a single line. And if we have a single line, we have a linear order, i.e a total order.</p>
<p>The relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, on the other hand, only defines a partial order. While we do still have a rough order between numbers based on their recursive digit sum, numbers with the same digit sum are unordered with respect to each other. This can be seen clearly in the corresponding figure. We are still dealing with some kind of ranking, though, as all elements in the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-th column of the figure are ranked higher than all the elements in the columns to their right. We still have a ranking of sorts, there’s just a lot elements that occupy the same rank.</p>
<h3 id="recap-1">Recap</h3>
<ul>
<li>Binary relations can be used to induce an order over a set, yielding an <strong>ordered set</strong> (e.g. the natural numbers with <span class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span>).</li>
<li>Orders must be ranking-like. They cannot contain any loops or cycles, and it must the case that if <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> outranks something that outranks <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> outranks <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.</li>
<li>The order is <strong>total</strong> (or <strong>linear</strong>) iff all elements of the set are related to each other. Intuitively, total orders build lines.</li>
<li>Partial orders allow some elements to be unordered with respect to each other. Intuitively, they cannot be represented by a single line and instead require more complex arrangements.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="strict-order-relations">Strict order relations</h2>
<p>There are numerous types of order relations. We will start out with strict orders as the definitions are slightly more intuitive in this case. After that, we will look at weak orders.</p>
<h3 id="strict-partial-orders-and-strict-total-orders">Strict partial orders and strict total orders</h3>
<p>Strict orders can be partial or total. Their definitions are very succinct, but require specialized vocabulary.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>A <strong>strict partial order</strong> is a binary relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> that is</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>transitive</strong>: for all <span class="math inline">\(x, y, z\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} z\)</span> jointly imply <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} z\)</span>, and</li>
<li><strong>irreflexive</strong>: there is no <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} x\)</span>, and</li>
<li><strong>asymmetric</strong>: for all <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, if <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span>, then it is not the case that <span class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} x\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p>A <strong>strict total order</strong> is a strict partial order that is <strong>semiconnex</strong>: for all <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, if <span class="math inline">\(x \neq y\)</span> then it holds that <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} x\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>These are very abstract definitions. In order to truly understand them, you have to develop an intuitive grasp of what each property means.</p>
<h3 id="transitivity">Transitivity</h3>
<p>Suppose you have some set <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> of objects with a binary relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> defined over them. For example, we may have the set of natural numbers with the <em>strictly less than</em> relation <span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span>, where we have <span class="math inline">\(3 &lt; 5\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(4 &lt; 5\)</span>, but not <span class="math inline">\(5 &lt; 5\)</span> (although <span class="math inline">\(5 \leq 5\)</span>). We can think of these as structures where the set specifies the collection of building blocks and the relation connects these building blocks, putting them into a particular structural configuration. We can move through <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> along <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>: if we are at <span class="math inline">\(x \in D\)</span>, we can move to any <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span>. And from <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, we can move on to any <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} z\)</span>, and so on.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>From the natural number <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>, we can move to <span class="math inline">\(17\)</span> via <span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span>, and from there to <span class="math inline">\(329\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>This movement metaphor is very useful for understanding transitivity and other properties of relations. Some relations are such that whatever can be reached in two steps can also be reached in one step. So <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} z\)</span> entail that we also have <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} z\)</span> — the ability to move from <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> via <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> implies that we can move directly from <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> without a stop at <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. Such relations are called <strong>transitive</strong>.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>A binary relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> over <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is <strong>transitive</strong> iff for all <span class="math inline">\(x,y,z \in D\)</span> it holds that <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} z\)</span> jointly imply <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} z\)</span>. This must be the case even if <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> are not distinct.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>The human ancestor relation <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is transitive. Your mother is one of your ancestors, and every ancestor of your mother is an ancestor of yourself. So <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{A} y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{A} z\)</span> imply <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{A} z\)</span>.</p>
<p>What about the sibling relation <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>? Well, if John is a sibling of Mary and Mary is a sibling of Sue, then John is a sibling of Sue. So it looks like it is transitive. But it’s not! For a relation to be transitive, it is not enough that some cases obey transivitiy. All cases have to. So let’s look at this counterexample: John is a sibling of Mary, and Mary is a sibling of John, yet John is not his own sibling. In formal terms, we have <span class="math inline">\(\text{John} \mathrel{S} \text{Mary}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\text{Mary} \mathrel{S} \text{John}\)</span>, yet <span class="math inline">\(\text{John} \not\mathrel{S} \text{John}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Many other relations are not transitive, either. The human parent-of relation is not transitive, because there can be <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is the parent of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is the parent of <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>, but <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is not the parent of <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>. In fact, that is how things are supposed to go in the real world and every deviation from this case is very problematic.</p>
<p>Sometimes a relation may partially meet the requirements of transitivity, but not for all elements of the domain. We have already seen this with the sibling relation, but let’s consider another case. You may love your parents, your parents love their parents, and you love your grandparents. So this is a case where we have <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} z\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} z\)</span>. But obviously love is not a transitive relation — it is perfectly possible for a person you love to love somebody that you do not love at all. This shows that a relation is transitive only if there isn’t even a single counterexample to transitivity.</p>
</div>
<p>Intuitively, transitivity tells us that whatever can be reached in two steps can be reached in one step. But this actually implies that anything that can be reached in a finite number of steps can be reached in one step. This follows by iterated invocation of transitivity. Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(a \mathrel{R} b\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b \mathrel{R} c\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(c \mathrel{R} d\)</span>. This is shown pictorially below.</p>
<p><img src="transitivity1.svg" alt="transitivity1.svg" /></p>
<p>Then by transitivity, we also have <span class="math inline">\(a \mathrel{R} c\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="transitivity2.svg" alt="transitivity2.svg" /></p>
<p>But then, again by transitivity, we must also have <span class="math inline">\(a \mathrel{R} d\)</span> because of <span class="math inline">\(a \mathrel{R} c\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c \mathrel{R} d\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="transitivity3.svg" alt="transitivity3.svg" /></p>
<p>Since we can apply the same argument over and over again, anything that can be reached with a finite number of steps can also be reached in a single step.</p>
<p>It is also important to keep in mind that some relations can be trivially transitive, such as the relation below. Here there are no <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> such that we have both <span class="math inline">\(a \mathrel{R} b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b \mathrel{R} c\)</span>, so transitivity holds because we cannot produce any counterexample to the claim that the relation is transitive.</p>
<p><img src="transitivity_trivial.svg" alt="transitivity_trivial.svg" /></p>
<p>Nor does transitivity imply that we can reach every element from every other element with a single step. Nodes may still be unreachable from certain positions. In the natural numbers, for example, <span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span> is transitive, yet it does not allow us to reach <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(8\)</span> (only the other way round).</p>
<h3 id="irreflexivity">Irreflexivity</h3>
<p>Irreflexivity is much easier to understand than transitivity as it simply requires that no element be related to itself. In pictorial terms, an element is related to itself if there is a loop from the corresponding node back to itself. Only if there isn’t a single node with such a loop is the relation <strong>irreflexive</strong>.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> be a binary relation over <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is <strong>irreflexive</strong> iff there is no <span class="math inline">\(x \in D\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} x\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>The human parent-of relation is irreflexive because nobody can be their own parent. Similarly, <span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span> over natural numbers is irreflexive because no number can be strictly less than itself. However, <span class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span> is not irreflexive because <span class="math inline">\(x \leq x\)</span> for every number <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Another relation that is not irreflexive is the relation induced by the identity function <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{id}\)</span>, which maps every element to itself. This is shown below for the set <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1,2,3,4 \right \}\)</span> with the identity relation:</p>
<p><img src="1234.svg" alt="1234.svg" /></p>
</div>
<p>Note that pictures can sometimes be misleading when it comes to irreflexivity. Consider the figure below.</p>
<p><img src="irreflexivity_violated.svg" alt="irreflexivity_violated.svg" /></p>
<p>It looks like this relation is irreflexive because no node has a loop back to itself. But it is common style for such figures to omit all connections that can be inferred via transitivity. So if this figure actually depicts a transitivity relation, then <span class="math inline">\(a \mathrel{R} b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b \mathrel{R} a\)</span> implies <span class="math inline">\(a \mathrel{R} a\)</span> because of transitivity. A clear violation of irreflexivity.</p>
<h3 id="asymmetry">Asymmetry</h3>
<p>A relation is asymmetric iff two elements can only be related in one direction, not both.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> be a binary relation over <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is <strong>asymmetric</strong> iff it holds for all <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> that <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> implies <span class="math inline">\(y \not\mathrel{R} x\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>The human parent-of relation is asymmetric. If John is a parent of Mary, then Mary cannot be a parent of John — assuming that there are no time travel shenanigans.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>The brother-of relation is not asymmetric. Yes, John may be a brother of Mary yet Mary isn’t a brother of John, which satisfies the asymmetry requirement. But we have to look at all relevant cases. There is at least one John out there who is a brother of a male human, who in turn would be the brother of John. Asymmetry is violated.</p>
</div>
<p>As with irreflexivity, some transitive relations may not be asymmetric even though they look like it.</p>
<p><img src="asymmetry_violated.svg" alt="asymmetry_violated.svg" /></p>
<p>It looks like the figure above contains no two nodes <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} x\)</span> both hold. But once again the figure might just omit the parts of the relation that can be inferred from transitivity. If so, then <span class="math inline">\(b \mathrel{R} c\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(c \mathrel{R} d\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(d \mathrel{R} a\)</span> jointly imply <span class="math inline">\(b \mathrel{R} a\)</span>. But we already have <span class="math inline">\(a \mathrel{R} b\)</span>, so asymmetry is violated.</p>
<h3 id="semiconnexity">Semiconnexity</h3>
<p>A relation is <strong>semiconnex</strong> iff all elements of the set are related to each other. Pictorially, there has to be some line between any two given nodes ( the lines that can be inferred via transitivity).</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>A binary relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> over set <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is <strong>semiconnex</strong> iff <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} x\)</span> holds for all <span class="math inline">\(x, y \in D\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(x \neq y\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">

<h2 id="weak-order-relations">Weak order relations</h2>
<p>Once you have a firm understanding of strict orders, weak orders are very simple: a weak order is a strict order that is reflexive instead of irreflexive. That is to say, every element is related to itself. In the figurative format we have used, this means that every node also has a loop back to itself (although this loop is usually not drawn if it’s already known that we’re dealing with a weak order). The typical example of a weak order is <span class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span> over natural numbers, which only differs from <span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span> in that <span class="math inline">\(x \leq x\)</span> while <span class="math inline">\(x \not&lt; x\)</span>. This small difference to strict orders is pretty much all there is to weak orders, but this minor change requires a few changes in our definitions.</p>
<h3 id="weak-orders">Weak orders</h3>
<p>The definition of weak orders replaces the irreflexivity property of strict orders with a reflexivity requirement. Since reflexive relations cannot be asymmetric, asymmetry is weakened to <strong>antisymmetry</strong>.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>A <strong>weak partial order</strong> is a binary relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> that is</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>transitive</strong>: for all <span class="math inline">\(x, y, z\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} z\)</span> jointly imply <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} z\)</span>, and</li>
<li><strong>reflexive</strong>: it holds for every <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> that <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} x\)</span>, and</li>
<li><strong>antisymmetry</strong>: for all <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, if <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} x\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(x = y\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Just like strict total orders are strict partial orders that are semi-connex, weak total orders are weak partial orders that are <strong>connex</strong>.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>A <strong>weak total order</strong> is a weak partial order that is <strong>connex</strong>: for all <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, it holds that <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} x\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="reflexivity">Reflexivity</h3>
<p>Reflexivity is a very simple property: a relation is reflexive iff every element is related to itself.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> be a binary relation over <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is <strong>reflexive</strong> iff it holds for all <span class="math inline">\(x \in D\)</span> that <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} x\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>If there is at least one element that is not related to itself, the relation is not reflexive. However, that does not imply that the relation is irreflexive, as that is only the case if not a single element is related to itself. In cases where some but not all elements are related to themselves, the relation is <strong>non-reflexive</strong>.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>The “same height” relation is reflexive as everything has the same height as itself. There simply cannot be any object <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> does not have the same height as <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>Suppose that John voted for Mary, and Mary voted for herself. We can represent this as a relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\text{John} \mathrel{R} \text{Mary}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\text{Mary} \mathrel{R} \text{Mary}\)</span>. This relation is not reflexive because <span class="math inline">\(\text{John} \not\mathrel{R} \text{John}\)</span>. But it isn’t irreflexive either because <span class="math inline">\(\text{Mary} \mathrel{R} \text{Mary}\)</span>. Hence it is non-reflexive.</p>

<div class="example">
<p>Here’s a surprising one: there is a relation that is both reflexive and irreflexive.

In this case, there is no <span class="math inline">\(x \in D\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} x\)</span>, which means that <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is irreflexive. But there’s also no <span class="math inline">\(x \in D\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(x \not\mathrel{R} x\)</span>, which is the same as saying that <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} x\)</span> holds for every <span class="math inline">\(x \in D\)</span> (there simply happen to be no <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>).

<p>You might object that there are many choices for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> whose difference isn’t <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span>, for example <span class="math inline">\(|5 - 2| = 3\)</span>. But that’s immaterial for symmetry. Symmetry has nothing to say about relations between arbitrary elements, it only tells us that if <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is related to <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is related to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> isn’t related to <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> to begin with, then symmetry simply doesn’t care.</p>

<p>If a relation is neither symmetric, nor asymmetric, nor antisymmetric, then it is <strong>non-symmetric</strong>.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider the relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(x \leq y\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(|x| = |y|\)</span>. This relation is not symmetric. For instance, <span class="math inline">\(2 \leq 3\)</span> entails that <span class="math inline">\(2 \mathrel{R} 3\)</span> holds, yet we do not have <span class="math inline">\(3 \mathrel{R} 2\)</span> because neither <span class="math inline">\(3 \leq 2\)</span> nor <span class="math inline">\(|3| = |2|\)</span> are true. It is not asymmetric because it is reflexive: <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} x\)</span> always holds because <span class="math inline">\(x \leq x\)</span>. Yet it is not antisymmetric either. This is witnessed by <span class="math inline">\(-2 \mathrel{R} 2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(2 \mathrel{R} -2\)</span> (because <span class="math inline">\(|-2| = |2|\)</span>) even though <span class="math inline">\(-2 \neq 2\)</span>. With all symmetry options exhausted, this only leaves us to conclude that <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is non-symmetric.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>The empty relation is symmetric, asymmetric, and antisymmetric. That’s because its domain is the empty set. If there are no <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span>, then it is impossible to violate symmetry, asymmetry, or antisymmetry.

<h3 id="connexity">Connexity</h3>
<p>A relation is <strong>connex</strong> iff it is reflexive and semi-connex.

But if a relation is reflexive, then <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> is necessarily the case whenever <span class="math inline">\(x = y\)</span>. So we can just drop the requirement that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are distinct and stipulate that <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} x\)</span> holds no matter whether <span class="math inline">\(x = y\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(x \neq y\)</span>.</p>

<p>With all those different notions of reflexivity, symmetry, and connexity, it is easy to get confused about the various types of orders. But they are all very similar, in fact. The key difference between weak and strict orders is whether the relation is reflexive or irreflexive. The key difference between partial and total orders is whether semi-connexity holds.</p>

<p>Some of these properties, like symmetry, aren’t useful for separating the four types of orders, but will allow us later on to distinguish them from equivalence relations or preorders.</p>
<p>Still, the tables above can be simplified quite a bit:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Remember that every asymmetric relation is also antisymmetric. And every irreflexive, antisymmetric relation is asymmetric. For the purposes of distinguishing weak and strict partial orders, we don’t really need to list asymmetry. It’s enough to know that both are antisymmetric relations that are either reflexive or irreflexive.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, every connex relation is semiconnex. And if a relation is reflexive and semi-connex, then it is connex. So we don’t need to list connexity either. All we need to say is that partial orders are reflexive and semi-connex whereas strict orders are irreflexive and semi-connex.</p></li>

<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> be some fixed domain over which we define a relation <span class="math inline">\(R \subseteq D \times D\)</span>. The <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-closure of <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is the smallest <span class="math inline">\(R&#39;\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(R \subseteq R&#39; \subseteq D \times D\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> has property <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. For example, the reflexive, symmetric, transitive closure of <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is the smallest superset <span class="math inline">\(R&#39;\)</span> that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider the relation <span class="math inline">\(R \mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{  \left \langle 1,2 \right \rangle, \left \langle 2,3 \right \rangle, \left \langle 3,4 \right \rangle  \right \}\)</span>. We want to compute its transitive closure. We first add <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 1,3 \right \rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 2,4 \right \rangle\)</span>, which we can construct from the existing pairs via transitivity. But the result is still not transitive The relation now contains both <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 1,3 \right \rangle\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 3,4 \right \rangle\)</span>, so we also have to add <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 1,4 \right \rangle\)</span>. At this point, the relation is transitive, so we do not add any more edges.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider the relation <span class="math inline">\(R \mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{  \left \langle 1,2 \right \rangle, \left \langle 3,2 \right \rangle  \right \}\)</span>. Its transitive closure is just <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>.</p>

<h2 id="types-of-relations">Types of relations</h2>
<p>Weak partial orders and total orders are just two particular types of relations. There are several others.</p>
<h3 id="preorder">Preorder</h3>
<p>The most basic order relation is the <strong>preorder</strong>, which is like a weak partial order but lacks antisymmetry. So it is transitive and reflexive, but not necessarily anything beyond that.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>A relation <span class="math inline">\(R \subseteq D \times D\)</span> is a <strong>preorder</strong> iff it is reflexive and transitive.</p>
</div>
<p>If one takes a preorder and adds antisymmetry, one gets a weak partial order. If one adds symmetry instead, one gets an <strong>equivalence relation</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="relation_types.svg" alt="relation_types.svg" /></p>
<h3 id="equivalence-relations">Equivalence relations</h3>
<div class="definition">
<p>A relation <span class="math inline">\(R \subseteq D \times D\)</span> is an <strong>equivalence relation</strong> iff it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.</p>
</div>
<p>Intuitively, an equivalence relation does exactly what its name implies: it relates elements that are equivalent with respect to some property that the relation is sensitive to.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>One equivalence relation that everybody is familiar with is the equality <span class="math inline">\(=\)</span> of numbers. But it isn’t a particularly insightful relation. It is reflexive as <span class="math inline">\(n = n\)</span> for every number <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. It also satisfies symmetry and transitivity, but that’s because <span class="math inline">\(x = y\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are the same number. So symmetry holds because <span class="math inline">\(x = y\)</span> obviously implies <span class="math inline">\(y = x\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are the same number. For the same reason, transitivity must hold, too: <span class="math inline">\(x = y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y = z\)</span> can be the case only if <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> are all the same number, in which case <span class="math inline">\(x = z\)</span> is of course true.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>A more interesting example is equivalence modulo <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>.

First, it is clearly refleixve: <span class="math inline">\(x \equiv_2 x\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(x \mod 2 = x \mod 2\)</span>, which always holds. Next, symmetry is also satisfied: <span class="math inline">\(x \equiv_2 y\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(x \mod 2 = y \mod 2\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(y \mod 2 = x \mod 2\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(y \equiv_2 x\)</span>.</p>

<h3 id="equivalence-classes-and-partitions">Equivalence classes and partitions</h3>
<p>Given an equivalence relation <span class="math inline">\(R \subseteq D \times D\)</span> and element <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\([x]\)</span> is the <strong>equivalence class</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. It contains all elements that are equivalent to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> according to <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>. Formaly, <span class="math inline">\([x] \mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{  y \mid x R y \right \}\)</span>. Keep in mind that <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is reflexive, so <span class="math inline">\(x \in [x]\)</span>.</p>
<p>Also, symmetry and transitivity entail that <span class="math inline">\(x \in [y]\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(y \in [x]\)</span>. So it follows from <span class="math inline">\(x \in [y]\)</span> that <span class="math inline">\([x] = [y]\)</span>. Hence it doesn’t matter which member of an equivalence class one uses in its name, there is no difference between <span class="math inline">\([x]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\([y]\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> belong go the same equivalence class.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider again the modulo 2 relation <span class="math inline">\(\equiv_2\)</span>. It gives rise to two equivalence classes. The first ist <span class="math inline">\([0] \mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{ 0, 2, 4, 6, \ldots \right \}\)</span>, which contains all even numbers, and the other is <span class="math inline">\([1] \mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{ 1, 3, 5, 7, \ldots \right \}\)</span>, the set of odd numbers. We could also refer to them as <span class="math inline">\([2]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\([3]\)</span>, respectively, or <span class="math inline">\([10]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\([7]\)</span>, it really does not matter.</p>

<div class="exercise">
<p>Intuitively, what equivalence classes does the continent mate relation yield?</p>
</div>
<p>Note that equivalence classes never overlap, they are disjoint sets. Given a set <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and an equivalence relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, no member of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> can belong to more than one equivalence class.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(x \in [y]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x \in [z]\)</span>, but <span class="math inline">\([y] \neq [z]\)</span>. Why is this impossible?</p>
</div>
<p>In addition, an equivalence relation over a set <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is usually chosen in such a way that every element of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> belongs to an equivalence class.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>In principle, one could combine the set <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ a,b,c \right \}\)</span> with the equivalence relation <span class="math inline">\(R \mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{ \left \langle a,a \right \rangle, \left \langle a,b \right \rangle, \left \langle b,a \right \rangle, \left \langle b,b \right \rangle \right \}\)</span>. But it is more natural to extend the relation to <span class="math inline">\(R&#39; \mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{ \left \langle a,a \right \rangle, \left \langle a,b \right \rangle, \left \langle b,a \right \rangle, \left \langle b,b \right \rangle, \left \langle c,c \right \rangle \right \}\)</span>. Intuitively, <span class="math inline">\(R&#39;\)</span> is exactly like <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> except that there is also an equivalence class for elements that <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is not defined for.</p>
</div>
<p>Given these assumptions, every member of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> belongs to exactly one equivalence class. The equivalence classes thus add an additional layer of structure to <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. They break it down into a collection of non-overlapping, non-empty subsets (the equivalence classes) that fully cover <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. This is also called a <strong>partition</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, and one says that <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> partitions <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. Each equivalence class is also called a <strong>cell</strong> of the partition.</p>
<h3 id="quotient-structure">Quotient structure</h3>
<p>Given an equivalence relation <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(S/\sim \mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{  [x] \mid x \in S \right \}\)</span> is the partition <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> induces on <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. This is also called a <strong>quotient set</strong> (yes, there’s many different names for the same thing here). Sometimes, <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> may have some additional operation or relation defined on it. It may be possible to lift this operation or relation from <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> to its quotient set <span class="math inline">\(S/\sim\)</span>. In this case, one obtains a <strong>quotient structure</strong>.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider once more the  equivalence relation <span class="math inline">\(\equiv_2\)</span>. Over the natural numbers, it induces a quotient set consisting of <span class="math inline">\([0]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\([1]\)</span>, the even and odd numbers, respectively. Now suppose that we add addition as an operation to the natural numbers. Then it holds that <span class="math inline">\((m + n) \mod 2 = ([m] + [n]) \mod 2\)</span>. In other words, there are two different ways of computing the desired result. The first option operates on <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. One adds the two numbers and then takes the sum modulo 2. Alternatively, one can look at the quotient set. Take the two equivalence classes, and take their sum by picking the smallest number from each equivalence class and adding them together. Then apply modulo 2 as before.</p>
<p>Here’s what this looks like with specific numbers. Suppose you want to calculate <span class="math inline">\((10,222 + 13,728,529) \mod 2\)</span>. You could add this up to <span class="math inline">\(13,738,751\)</span>, divide by two, and get a remainder of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. But you probably realized right away that the first number is even and the second one odd, so their sum will be odd, which means that division by 2 will leave a remainder of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. In other words, you have computed the result with the quotient structure. First you noted that <span class="math inline">\(10,222 \in [0]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(13,728,529 \in [1]\)</span>. As <span class="math inline">\([0] + [1] = 0 + 1 = 1\)</span>, you immediately get a remainder of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Quotient structures are a very powerful concept, in particular when it comes to designing efficient algorithms. A set may contain millions of elements, and the operations on the set may take a long time to compute on some of those elements. But you might be able to build a much smaller quotient structure, and the operations may be faster over equivalence classes because you can pick very simple representatives of each class. After all, <span class="math inline">\((3 + 5) \mod 7\)</span> is a much easier way to calculate the output of <span class="math inline">\((7,003 + 14,726) \mod 7\)</span>.</p>
