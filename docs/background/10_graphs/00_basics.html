<h1 id="the-basics-of-graphs">The basics of graphs</h1>
<div class="prereqs">
<ul>
<li>relations (basic orders)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>A graph consists of at least two components. The first is the set of nodes. When talking about graphs, every node is usually called a <strong>vertex</strong>, so instead of the graph’s set of nodes we talk about the graph’s set <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> of <strong>vertices</strong>. In addition, there is an edge relation <span class="math inline">\(E \subseteq V \times V\)</span> that connects vertices to each other. When drawing graphs, the edges in <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> are represented by arrows.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>The graph depicted below has <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 0,1,2,\ldots,11 \right \}\)</span> as its set of vertices, and <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> consists of the following tuples:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 0,3 \right \rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 0,6 \right \rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 0,9 \right \rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 3,0 \right \rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 3,6 \right \rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 3,9 \right \rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 6,0 \right \rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 6,3 \right \rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 6,9 \right \rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 9,0 \right \rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 9,3 \right \rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 9,6 \right \rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 1,4 \right \rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 1,7 \right \rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 1,10 \right \rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 4,1 \right \rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 4,7 \right \rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 4,10 \right \rangle\)</span></li>
<li>and so on</li>
</ul>

</div>
<p>By default, we take the edges of a graph to be <em>directed</em>: <span class="math inline">\(a E b\)</span> does not imply <span class="math inline">\(b E a\)</span>. This is why we depicted edges with arrows. You may think of them as a one-way roads.</p>
<p>In the special case where <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is symmetric, we call the graph <strong>undirected</strong>. It is customary to draw undirected graphs with undirected edges rather than separate arrows in both directions. Since the edge relation in our example graph is symmetric, we can draw it in a much simpler fashion using undirected edges.</p>
<p><img src="modulo3_undirected.svg" alt="modulo3_undirected.svg" /></p>
<p>If the edge relation is transitive, it is also customary not to draw any edges that can be inferred by transitivity. This convention further simplifies how we depict our example graph.</p>
<p><img src="modulo3_undirected_notransitive.svg" alt="modulo3_undirected_notransitive.svg" /></p>
<p>But keep in mind that these three pictures all define the same graph, we are merely using various notational conventions to remove clutter from our pictures. Mathematically, how we draw graphs has nothing to do with their definition.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>A <em>graph</em> is a pair <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle V, E \right \rangle\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is a set of <strong>vertices</strong> and <span class="math inline">\(E \subseteq V \times V\)</span> is the <strong>edge</strong> relation.</p>
</div>
<p>Note that the definition above treats undirected graphs as the special case of directed graphs where <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is symmetric. Some authors instead assume that graphs are undirected by default and use the term <strong>digraph</strong> to refer to a directed graph. Either one is fine, of course, but for linguistics directed graphs are usually more important than undirected ones, which is why we will continue to treat undirected graphs as a special case of directed graphs.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>For each on the hierarchies listed below, define its corresponding graph.</p>
<ul>
<li>the person hierarchy</li>
<li>the person-person hierarchy used for the PCC</li>
<li>the case hierarchy for noun stem allmorphy</li>
</ul>
<p>Each edge you posit should correspond to a line in the figure for the relevant hierarchy.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="paths-and-reachability">Paths and Reachability</h2>
<p>One of the central notions for graphs is <strong>reachability</strong>. A vertex <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is reachable from vertex <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> iff we can follow a sequence of edges from <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. This sequence is called a <strong>path</strong>.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider one more the following graph, and assume that the edge relation contains a pair <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle a,b \right \rangle\)</span> iff there is a line from <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> in the picture:</p>
<p><img src="modulo3_undirected_notransitive.svg" alt="modulo3_undirected_notransitive.svg" /></p>
<p>Here <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> is reachable from <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> because there is an edge taking us from <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>. But <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> is also reachable from <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> as we can first move to <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> and from there <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span>. The path from <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> can be written as <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 0,3,6 \right \rangle\)</span>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> is not reachable from <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. No matter which sequence of edges we take from <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, there is no way to ever get to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p>A <strong>path</strong> through a graph <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle V, E \right \rangle\)</span> is a sequence <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle v_1, \ldots, v_n \right \rangle\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(n \geq 2\)</span>) such that <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle v_i, v_{i+1} \right \rangle \in E\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(1 \leq i &lt; n\)</span>. For all <span class="math inline">\(a, b \in V\)</span>, we say that <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is reachable from <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> iff there is a path <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle v_1, \ldots, v_n \right \rangle\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(v_1 = a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_n = b\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>As always in mathematics, there are multiple ways of saying the same thing, and the same is true for reachability. A node <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is reachable from <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> in graph <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle V, E \right \rangle\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle a,b \right \rangle\)</span> is member of the transitive closure of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>. The transitive closure of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is the smallest <span class="math inline">\(E&#39;\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(E \subseteq E&#39; \subseteq V \times V\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(E&#39;\)</span> is transitive.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider the graph below.</p>
<p><img src="modulo3_directed_weak.svg" alt="modulo3_directed_weak.svg" /></p>
<p>Its edge relation <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> consists of the pairs <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 0,3 \right \rangle\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 0,9 \right \rangle\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 3,6 \right \rangle\)</span>. The transitive closure <span class="math inline">\(E&#39;\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> also contains <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 0,6 \right \rangle\)</span>. This is the smallest superset of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> that is transitive. The transitive closure of <span class="math inline">\(E&#39;\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(E&#39;\)</span> itself — since <span class="math inline">\(E&#39;\)</span> is already transitive, nothing needs to be added. The symmetric closure <span class="math inline">\(E&#39;&#39;\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(E&#39;\)</span> must also contain <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 3,0 \right \rangle\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 9,0 \right \rangle\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 6,3 \right \rangle\)</span>. Now if we take the transitive closure of <span class="math inline">\(E&#39;&#39;\)</span>, every node is connected to every node, so the edge relation is identical to <span class="math inline">\(V \times V\)</span>. Thus the transitive, symmetric closure of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(V \times V\)</span> because there is no smaller extension of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> that is both symmetric and transitive.</p>
