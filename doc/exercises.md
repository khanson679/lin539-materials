# Interactive exercises

## Usage

A test GUI program written with Tkinter is available. The program is intended primarily for testing question generation and display, but is basically usable as is. To use it, run the file `gui.py` from the exercises directory.

The program allows the user to select any question type directly from the top menu. It displays randomly generated questions only. It is not necessary to input an answer before showing the correct answer or moving to the next question.

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.9.4
- Matplotlib >= 3.3.4
- Numpy >= 1.19.5
- Pillow (provides PIL) >= 8.1.2
	- Packages "python3-pil" and "python3-pil.imagetk"
- PyDot >= 1.4.2

The program has been tested only on Ubuntu 21.04, and the above requirements are installed from the Ubuntu repositories. It may work with an older Python interpreter and libraries, but has not been tested yet.
